*** Done ***
Weight masking - soft position bins - This is too expensive so give up. I just realized that the cost is ultra high
Better memory management to handle 5120 pts - Done ! BatchSize 16 with FP16 worked.

*** ToDo ***
Spatial-Temporal k-NN graphs (latent space)
LSTM / GRU Simlator
Weight norm?
Better convolution sturcutre. omg.

*** Memo ***
Evaluation:
-- FOR AUTO-ENCODER PAPER
ShapeNet CC - MAIN Focusing
Fluid dynamics
LJP dynamics
-- FOR SIMULATOR AND AE
QM9 Dataset
